    "# Unix utility emulation\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is an example of emulation unix utilities in Python.  I was prompted by another blog posting about the difficulties of Unix shell scripting. The blogger was trying to accumulate the time taken to execute a given script multiple times (difficulties arose because Unix Shell scripting doesn't do floating calculations easily).  Ignoring the details, I wondered how I would do the core script in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "See: https://blog.plover.com/Unix/tools.html\n",
    "\n",
    " ```awk '{print $11}' FILE_NAME_PATTERN | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | grep -v EXCLUDE_PATTERN```\n",
    " \n",
    " Basically, this says:\n",
    " \n",
    " - For all files with names that match a specified pattern\n",
    " \n",
    " - Read the file, extracting the 11-th field of each line\n",
    " \n",
    " - Sort the fields\n",
    " \n",
    " - Use ```uniq``` output the unique field values, and append the count of the unique field values\n",
    " \n",
    " - Sort into ascending order\n",
    " \n",
    " - Exclude fields that match a given pattern.\n",
    " \n",
    " The script is being used to process website logs."
