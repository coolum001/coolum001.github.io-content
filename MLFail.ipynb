    "A little while ago, I created a machine learning App to recognize Australian urban birds.  I took the Australian Museum list of the 30  most common small urban birds, and used the ```fastai``` methodology and libraries to train a recognizer for each bird species.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had a unique and refreshing approach to input data quality:  I had none at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the common name of the bird, did a google image search, and used the top 200 thumbnail images returned, with no vetting at all.  This was part of an experiment to see how far you could get with the lazy persons approach to Machine Learning.\n",

My bird recognizer really just matches by textures, and these two birds have completely different textures, so it is no wonder that recognition failed."
