This was a challenge to put your resume up on the Internet, in a fully cloud-enabled way, using Amazon Web Services (AWS) offerings  (see https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/).  I found it interesting, a little bit challenging, and am learning more about AWS.\n",

If I had been a true DevOps, I would have done it all either via the Command Line Interface (CLI), or from Python.  This would have created a repeatable process, that could be documented, and placed under configuration control.\n",
